  /**
   *@class  CameraFrameBuffer
   *@brief  Will manage buffer that will allow two separate threads, one reading form the camera 
   * and the other processing the frames. 
   *@details  You will need one instance of this class for each Camera that you want to buffer data for.
   * It is meant to be used in a multi-threaded environment, specifically three threads, but more or
   * less can always access it.
   * 1) A thread that will acquire data from the camera and insert it into this buffer one frame 
   *    at a time.  It will use the 'AddFrame' method to do this.
   * 2) A thread that will process these frames by calling 'GetNextFrameToProcess' to get the next 
   *    frame in the stream and 'DoneProcessingFrame' when it is done processing the frame.
   * 3) A thread that will write the camera data to disk.  It will call 'GetNextFrameToWriteToDisk'
   *    to get the next frame and then call 'DoneWrittingFrameToDisk'  after it is done writing
   *    data to disk.
   *  
   * A 'GoalKeepeer' object 'gateKeeper' will be used to enforce integrity in the Multi-Threaded
   * environment.  It will guarantee that only one thread at a time can access the four queues
   * listed below.
   *
   * There are 4 CameraFrameList instances that will keep the frames organized.  
   *  buffer               - Maintains a list of all CameraFrames that have been allocated.  It will own 
   *                         these frames.  
   *  available            - This is the list of frames that are empty and available for new data from 
   *                         the camera.  The 'AddFrame' method will remove frame from this and populate
   *                         with camera data.
   *  waitingToProcess     - This is the list of frames that still need to be processed.  Entries are 
   *                         put in by the 'AddFrame' method and removed by the 'GetNextFrameToProcess'
   *                         'GetNextFrameToProcess'.
   *  waitingToWriteToDisk - The list of frames that need to be written to disk.  'AddFrame' will add
   *                         frames to the end of this list while 'GetNextFrameToProcess' will remove 
   *                         from the front.
