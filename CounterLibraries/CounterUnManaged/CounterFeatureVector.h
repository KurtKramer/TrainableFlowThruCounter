 *@class CounterUnManaged::CounterFeatureVector
 *@brief  Specialized version of KKMLL::FeatureVector that will be used 
 *to represent the features of a Shrimp.
 *@author  Kurt Kramer
 *@details
 * Used for the representation of a Single Plankton Image.  You create an instance of this object for 
 * each single image you need to keep track of.  There is a specialized version of KKMLL::FeatureFileIO 
 * calculated  KKMLL::FeatureFileIOKK that is used to write and read feature Data files. What makes this 
 * class of KKMLL::FeatureVector special are the additional fields that are Plankton specific such as 
 * centroidCol, centroidRow, latitude, longitude, numOfEdgePixels, centroid within SIPPEER file 
 * sfCentroidCol, sfCentroidRow and version.<p>
 *
 * The version number field is supposed to indicate which feature calculation routines were used.  This 
 * way if there are changes the way features are calculated it can be detected during runtime if the features
 * are up to date they need to be recomputed.
