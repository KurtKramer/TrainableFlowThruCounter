    @class  FeatureFileIOKK
    @brief  Supports the reading and writing of feature data from "KK" feature data files.
    @details
    @code
    * *************************************************************************************************
    * *  The KK feature data file is a very simple format where the first few rows contain a          *
    * *  description of the rest of the data file.  Any row that starts with "//" will be treated as  *
    * *  comment line.                                                                                *
    * *  First Row:  Identifies the file as a feature Data File.  An example on the next line.        *
    * *              "FEATURE_DATA_FILE Version	101	NumOfFeatures	20	NumOfExamples  258"             *
    * *              Each field will be separated by a tab character.  This line says that the        *
    * *              version number is 101. There are 20 features and 258 examples or feature vectors.*
    * *              The version number gets incremented whenever there is a change in the way        *
    * *              tha feature data is computed.                                                    *
    * *                                                                                               *
    * *  Second Row: List all the fields in the feature data file.  The first fields are feature      *
    * *              data.  The first non feature field will be: "ClassName".  There are several non  *
    * *              feature data fields.                                                             *
